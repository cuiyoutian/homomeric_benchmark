models/: folder with all the files used for docking 16 enzymes in benchmark


files:
*.enzdes.cst: constraint file with the enzymatic constraints used in docking
*_docking.xml: docking protocol used
*_conformers.pdb: the conformational library of the ligands
*.params: params file for docking

flags: file containing the Rosetta options used in docking

model.pdb: model to be used for docking. This includes the header that specifies the residues to be used from the enzdes.cst file and information about the ligand coordinates.
